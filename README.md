# To-Do List Application

## Project Overview
This To-Do List Application is a project developed for Coding Temple to demonstrate proficiency in Python programming. The objective of this project is to reinforce understanding of Python syntax, data types, control structures, functions, and error handling while building a practical and interactive application.

## Features
1. Add task(s)
2. View tasks
3. Mark a task as complete
4. Delete task(s)
5. Reorder tasks
6. Quit the application

## Learning Objectives
This project covers:
- Python syntax and data types
- Control structures (if/else statements, loops)
- Functions and modular programming
- Error handling with try/except blocks
- User input and data validation
- Basic data structures (lists, dictionaries)

## How to Run
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system (Python 3.6 or later is recommended).
2. Download the `todo_list.py` file.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt.
4. Navigate to the directory containing `todo_list.py`.
5. Run the following command:  python todo_list.py


## Using the Application
Upon running the application, you'll be presented with a menu of options:

1. **Add task(s)**: Allows you to add one or more tasks to your list. You can keep adding tasks until you choose to stop.

2. **View tasks**: Displays all tasks in your list along with their completion status.

3. **Mark a task as complete**: Lets you select a task to mark as complete.

4. **Delete task(s)**: Allows you to delete one or more tasks from your list. You can keep deleting tasks until you choose to stop.

5. **Reorder tasks**: Enables you to change the position of a task in the list, allowing you to prioritize your tasks.

6. **Quit**: Exits the application.

## Error Handling
The application includes robust error handling to manage unexpected user inputs, demonstrating proper exception handling techniques.
